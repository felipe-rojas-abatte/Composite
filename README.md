# Commposite

This repository holds all the information that served for the construction of the Composite project. In here we consider a simple scenario where the Higgs boson and two vector resonances are supposed to arise from a new strong interacting sector. We use the ATLAS measurements of the dijet spectrum to set limits on the masses of the resonances. Additionally we compute the Higgs boson decay to two photons and found, when compare to the Standard Model prediction, a small excess which is compatible with ATLAS measurements. Finally we make prediction for Higgs-strahlung processes for the LHC running at 14 TeV.
